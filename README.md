# Sprint 7 project [JavaScript Tests for GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests]

In this sprint project, we were required to create tests for the 4 separate endpoint requests with 2 tests for a single endpoint. The tests will be used with a Urban Grocers server. To complete the sprint project it was required to use the following apps an online repository and cloud storage called GitHub, the local Desktop files on a PC, Visual Studio code studio in order to visualy create javaScripts, Postman to launch and submit the requests for bug fixes and the Command Line to test the Scripts.

After cloning the files from the command line or via GitHub. There are packages or dependencies that need to be installed before the creation or attempt to test the endpoints. We go to the location of the project via the command line and run the code "npm install" to obtain the dependencies for testing. After all of the packages are installed you can start the Urban Grocers sever and add the URL in the "config" file via the notepad app. Now you are now ready to create and edit the tests codes. 

Once you’ve completed the steps you’re ready to work on the tasks. All 4 endpoints would need the following, we need to select one endpoint from the Urban Grocers documentation and write at least two tests. These tests should contain a check for the response status code. A check for a parsed response and check that the response body contains the expected data from the Urban Grocers server.

When all tests have been created in VS & Postman, we run the tests via Postman or the Command line using the "testName.npx jest" or "npx jest" in the project folder for response statuses and report the findings.
